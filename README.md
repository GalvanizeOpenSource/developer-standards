# Developer Standards

This repo is an attempt to define what standards/attributes make up a junior, mid, or senior software developer. It can be used to help developers identify areas of weakness and set goals to learn and grow.

[standards.md](standards.md) contains the list of standards and descriptions of expectations at the junior, mid, and senior level.

[transitions.md](transitions.md) contains possible ways a developer at a specific skill level for a standard can level up.

This is a constantly changing set of docs. Please submit PRs for anything you think is missing!
