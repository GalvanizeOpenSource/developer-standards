# Developer Standards

This repo is an attempt to define what standards/attributes make up a junior, mid, or senior web application developer. It can be used to help developers identify areas of weakness and set goals to learn and grow. While this list was created specifically with web developers in mind, it could easily be forked and extended to include mobile developers, hardware engineers, DevOps, or whatever other field you are focused on.

[standards_for_web_developers.md](standards_for_web_developers.md) contains the list of standards and descriptions of expectations at the junior, mid, and senior level.

[transitions.md](transitions.md) contains possible ways a developer at a specific skill level for a standard can level up. Items in bold have worked in the past for at least one person. Items with a question mark are currently being tested/attempted.

This is a constantly changing set of docs. Please submit PRs for anything you think is missing!
